Requires: python 3.x, regex, pandas, matplotlib

Input: input_txt file, inside of the input_data folder. Also, the user can choose from the command line what he want to do.

Output: Corresponding files in output_data

Options:
1 - Check the appations of all symbols 

2 - Check the apparitions of letters only

3 - Encrypt the input file

4 - Decrypt the file encrypted file using brute force

5 - Decrypt the file encrypted file using an input key

6 - Decrypt the file based on the letter with the most apparitions (read more about this in ReadMe file)*

* --> In English, the letter E it the most used letter. The point 6 is available only for english sentences inputs, with a considerable length, 
where the sentences are decrypted correlating the letter with the most apparitions with the letter E. It is not 100% accurate, 
but it was funny to try. :)
